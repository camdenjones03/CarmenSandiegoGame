Dear Agent {name},
Carmen Sandiego has stolen Dukeâ€™s helmet, and you need to help track her down using clues about possible destinations she has absconded to with it.
You have five days to catch up with her before she gets away. Each day you will be given one clue as to where Carmen is.
The hunt ends when you locate or fail to locate Carmen for 5 days.
